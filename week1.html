We kicked off the first week of Digital Fabrication and Engineering with group challenges.<br> The first challenge: Make the tallest structure soley made up of newspaper and tape that can withstand the force of a small fan on low power standing a few feet away.<br> <br> 
Me and my partner attempted to make a structure with a stable base but ultimately failed as it was not<br>very tall or able to withstand the force of the fan even at its lowest setting.
<br> 
<br>
The second challenge was to make something out of straws and 18 inches of tape. This particular structure had to stop a golf ball from bouncing<br> out after being dropped out of midair at a controlled height.<br>
Only three straws were allowed to actually come into contact with the ground. My group decided to make a contraption that, if all went according to plan, would act as a triangular shaped box of some sorts.<br>
Once again, my group failed.<br>
