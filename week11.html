		Final Project
<br><br>
For my final project I made a sign/light to hang on a wall or place on a desk/shelf of any sorts.<br> It is in the shape of a Les Paul guitar head with my logo and producer name laser cut into the top. Inside is a white LED backlight module. <br>It is all made from wood. 
<br><br>
I used wood, a toggle switch, battery pack, LED, paint, and wood stain. Not to mention the lasers. 
<br><br>
I spent almost every possible minute of my free time working on this project.<br> It took me about the entire rotation plus weekends, free periods, after school until 6, and A+. 
<br><br>
The machines I used the most were the table saw and the laser engraver. For the laser engraver, I was using vectors to cut out the shape of the guitar and the hole for my switch as well as the decoration on the front.<br> The vector settings were varied between 8/10/100 and 2/20/100 depending on whether I was using 1/8 of an inch of wood or 1/4 of an inch. 
<br><br>
I learned my way around Corel Draw a little better, and I learned how to use various tools such as drills, routers, and table saws. <br>I also learned the importance of planning, as it was something I had to do in the back of my head at times I wasnâ€™t in the WIC. 
	<br><br>
		Here are pictures that show my progress as I worked on the project:
